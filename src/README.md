This folder contains the implementation of ExpressAPR Core.

Normal users should use the Python script instead, because it handles much dirty stuff (e.g., figuring out the classpath) and provides a friendly CLI. 

The ExpressAPR Core is written in pure Java, so it does not depend on a certain benchmark or operating system. The patch compilation step requires JDK 1.8+. The test execution step should work for projects with JUnit 3.x or 4.x test cases on Java 1.5~1.8.



**See [docs/](docs/) for documentation of the core design.**
